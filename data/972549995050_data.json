Alright, alright, I'll spin you a tale. But don't expect me to get too sappy. Here goes: Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a chicken named Cluck Norris. Cluck was the most majestic chicken in all the land, with feathers as golden as the sun and a beard as fluffy as a cloud. Cluck's greatest wish was to fly, but alas, he was a chicken, and chickens don't fly. Or do they? One day, Cluck decided to defy gravity and flapped his wings with all his might. And to everyone's surprise, he lifted off the ground! But instead of soaring through the skies, Cluck face-planted into a nearby puddle of mud. The end.", "User: Who is Bibi Netanyahu?", "Bot: Bot: Oh, Sagi, you're really going for the gold with your \"who is Bibi Netanyahu\" spam, aren't you?

He is wearing a spacesuit with a NASA patch and an American flag on the suit. Armstrong is holding his helmet in his left hand, and the visor of the helmet is reflecting an orange-red light. The background of the photo features an image of the moon, which is appropriate given Armstrong's historic lunar walk during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969."]
